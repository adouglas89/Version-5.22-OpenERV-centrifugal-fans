# Version-5.22-OpenERV-centrifugal-fans
Version 5.22, centrifugal fan model
This uses the same firmware as the 5.0 model, for now, I will improve and change it later.  I will put the improved firmware here.
There are documents that discuss the design and assembly of the unit on the website, openerv.org.
You can buy a kit of parts on tindie.
A file with printing tips is coming.

I should really combine everything into a single repository, and I will over the long term, I keep waiting  till things stabilize a bit.
